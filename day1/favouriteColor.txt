PROJECT 1 : Favourite Color Picking 

In this We used a few concepts of JavaScript.
The Concepts are Variable, DOM Tree, getElementById() Method, textContent and Style properties, and onclick Event.

Variable : Containers for storing values. 
           - using keyword like "let".

Document Object Model (DOM): Structure reprasentation of HTML documnet created by the browser. It allows JavaScript to manupulate, Structure and style.

getElementById() : It helps to select html element with a specific Id.
                 - let heading = documnet.getElementById("headingElement");

textContent : To manipulate the text with in the html element.
                - heading.textContent = "yourText";

style : To set or get specific style of an html element using different CSS properties.
         - heading.style.color = "blue";
         - heading.style.fontFamily = "Roboto";
    -Use camelCase Notations for CSS properties.

Events : Events are the actions by which the user or browser interacts with the html elements.

onclick : Onclick Event occurs when the user clicks on html element. WE will give the name of the function as a value to the html onclick attribute.
      HTML   :  <button onclick="stles()">Styles</button>
   JavaScript:  function styles(){
            // code 
        }
